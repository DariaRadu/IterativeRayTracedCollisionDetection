# Iterative Ray-Traced Collision Detection

This project was made as an exam project for the course "Algorithms In Games" at ITU. It is based in Unity and it shows a simple implementation of the paper [New Iterative Ray-Traced Collision Detection Algorithm for GPU Architectures](https://hal.archives-ouvertes.fr/hal-00881773/document).
